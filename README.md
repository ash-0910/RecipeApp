# RecipeApp



The app works perfectly now with firebase . the firebase auth also works perfectly . i wrote tests which works perfectly by importing dummy data in firebase with the code that i have written in the test library . the data from firebase is getting retrieved to the recipes page and getting displayed to the page. I used firebase linq queries for retrieving data in the Indian and Italian recipes page . I faced issues while passing data from one view to another . I tried writing some code for it but i am having a little difficulty to pass data to the detail page to show it on the page . all the data is getting retrieved but i am having trouble to pass it to the detail page . All the test that I have written are passed . 
Another issue i was facing was to get the firebase child data to the indian and italian recipes page from firebase but then i overcame that issue by reading many articles and solutions from stackoverflow and various other websites and finally i was able to complete it .
Another issue that i was facing was that the code in the indian and italian recipes page was getting executed without waiting for the data to be retrieved from the firebase even though i was using async/await . then after a lot of research and trials i was able to get the code working . so now the data gets retrieved first from the firebase and then rest of the code gets executed on the pages .
