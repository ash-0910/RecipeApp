# RecipeApp

I created the library and also wrote tests for it . I was able to complete the firebase login and registration in the app . now the app works with firebase . I am having a little trouble to retrieve data to show in the pages . I used the JsonConvert.DeserializeObject method to get the json data that is getting retrieved from firebase and displaying it in the recipepage . I was trying to get another code running in the UI but I was not able to do it in this check in . I will complete it by the final checkin .
